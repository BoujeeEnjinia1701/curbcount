# CurbCount

**Area:** Smart Cities · **Status:** Concept · **Prototype budget:** about $150 USD · **Difficulty:** 3 of 5

A privacy-safe counter for people, bicycles and vehicles at street level that uses on-device detection and sends only counts, never images.

## Concept rationale

Counts without images give planners evidence while respecting residents.

## Burning platform

Street redesign decisions are contested, and counts of people walking and cycling are usually missing.

## Where it could be used

### By industry

| Industry | Use |
| --- | --- |
| _To be developed_ | |

### By country or region

| Country or region | Why it matters there |
| --- | --- |
| _To be developed_ | |

## What sparked the idea

It came out of a September 2026 review of Design Molecule's applied research areas against the open projects already in the lab. It opens the smart city set.

## Problem

Cities plan streets with little data on walking and cycling, and camera-based counting raises privacy concerns.

## Concept

A privacy-safe counter for people, bicycles and vehicles at street level that uses on-device detection and sends only counts, never images.

## Key components

- Low-resolution thermal or radar sensor
- Edge processor
- FieldNode power and radio core
- Pole mount

The working bill of materials is in [bom/bom.csv](bom/bom.csv).

## Safety

> Privacy by design: no images, audio recordings or personal identifiers leave the device; only aggregate counts or levels are stored. Check local data protection law before any deployment. Street furniture and pole mounts must be installed only with the asset owner's permission, by trained crews, with fall protection and traffic management as local rules require.
